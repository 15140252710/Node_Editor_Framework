This document was originally created by __Seneral__. It is still a WIP.

## Preface

This Documentation intends to give you an overview of the Node Editor. It was
initially posted by me,
[Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/), as a personal
project on the [Unity
forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230/#post-2134738)
After receiving a great amount of positive feedback I continued improving and
supporting it, now featuring alot of major things a Node Editor needs to have! 

The [Github repository](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor) was set
up by [baste](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/baste.185905/) during the early
developement, and now it's the main platform to share and contribute to Node
Editor.

## Features

The Node Editor is special in that it's open source, but still is packed full of
features, some of which are very unique to this project and which we're proud of
featuring:

- Full interface featuring all expected controls like zooming/panning
- Flexible and interchangeable GUI
- Canvas and Editor State system featuring alot of advanced controls
- Super easy to extend with custom nodes and types without modifying the
  provided code
- Flexible calculation system, soon supporting for state-like behaviour
- Extreme Node customization to create totally unique node appearances achieved
  by a custom windowing system
- Growing Runtime support, including every bit from the EditorWindow

The framework also shines with clean and easy to modify code. It's clearly
seperated in multiple parts, some of which can even be taken and used somewhere
else, such as the unique, generic scaling approach!

## Examples

You can start off by checking out the Editor Window at '_Window/Node Editor_'
and loading one of the example canvases, such as the CalculationCanvas.  Do that
by either loading it with the button at the top right or by locating it in the
project folder and double-clicking it.

With right-click you can add additional nodes, using drag'n'drop you can connect
node Outputs and Inputs with each other.

## Conclusion

(WIP) 

I'm happy that the Node Editor has received so much positive comments and
helpful critism since I posted it back in May 2015.

Since then a few people took the time and motivation to contribute to the
project which I appreciate very much! You can check all contributions out on
the contributions page. But also those who use, test and report bugs are very
important for this project.

If you wish to contribute, you may take a look at the roadmap as a rough
guideline what is planned and how you can help. Of course, own ideas are just
as fine.  Make sure to post or tell me if you are making an extension using
Node Editor, may it be big or small, and notify me about any problems you may
encounter:) This is vital to the project! Just make sure to account for the MIT
License included with Node Editor.

Also, you can always contact Seneral with a PM on the Forums or per Email at

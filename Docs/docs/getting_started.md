# Getting Started

Here you'll find some help on how to get you started creating custom Nodes and
ConnectionTypes in the simplest form, without touching the Framework code.
These two methods already can help you make little extensions requiring the Node
Editor Framework to be installed seperately.

## Custom nodes

The implementation of additional, custom nodes is fairly easy. You have to
create a script anywhere in the project extending the Node class of the
`NodeEditorFramework` namespace.  It will provide the Framework all
needed information about the node itself, the optional `Node`
Attribute contains information about the presentation in the editor.  The
Framework will search all script assemblies for additional nodes, so extra setup
is not required.

In the following are the necessary Node members outlined, based upon the
ExampleNode found at '_Plugins/Node\_Editor/Nodes_'. First to mention is that
even though the Framework is programmed in C#, you can add nodes in UnityScript
with the limitation that they have to be compiled in phase 2,3 or 4, as
described [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompileOrderFolders.html).
Therefore the following members are described language independently.

- `NodeEditorFramework` depedency
- Class extending `Node`
- _Optional_: Attribute `Node [params: [Bool] hide; [String] contextPath]`
- Unique Node ID; declare: `ID [constant string]`; expose: property
  `GetID[Override]`
- _Optional_: Behaviour Options
  - `AllowRecursion` [override, default: false]
  - `ContinueCalculation` [override, default: true]
  - `AcceptsTransitions` [override, default: false]
- Method `Create [override; Params: [Vector2] position; Returns : [Node] created
  node]`
  - Create a new Instance of your node type using `CreateInstance`. Assign it's
    property `rect` using the position parameter and give it a name.
  - Add connections using `CreateInput` / `CreateOutput` or `NodeInput.Create` /
    `NodeOuput.Create` [Params: Name; TypeName; NodeSide; position]
  - Perform any other additional setup steps and return your created node.
- Method `NodeGUI` [override]
  - Draw your Node's GUI in it. You may use GUILayout functions. 
  - Access the Inputs/Outputs using the Inputs/Outputs array in the creation
    order. Use their methods `DisplayLayout` or `SetPosition` to position (and
    draw) them.
- Method `NodeGUI` [override]
  - The methods `allInputsReady`, `hasUnassignedInputs` and
    `descendantsCalculated` may help to check if the node is ready, based on the
    needs and purposes of it.
  - Access the inputs as described above, call `GetValue` to get the value stored
    in the connection of the same type. Similarily, set the output values with
    `SetValue`.
  - Return _true_ when you're done calculating and _false_ when you are not ready
    yet and need another attempt. But be aware, you cannot yield calculation
    that way, after a maximum of a _thousand_ repeated tries the calculation will
    be aborted!

## Custom connection types

Implementing custom ConnectionTypes is similar to Node implementation, as it
uses the same fetching system: Declare a class inheriting from the
`ITypeDeclaration` interface and specify it's properties. 

<p>
  <img src="../img/ConnectionTypes.png"/>
  <br/>
  <center>ConnectionTypes.cs: Top Block: ITypeDeclaration; Bottom Block: Built-in Float type</center>
</p>


- The `String name` is used to adress the type later on
- The `Color col` is the color associated with the type, and the following knob
  textures aswell as the node connection curves are tinted with it
- The strings `InputKnob\TexPath` and `OutputKnob\TexPath` are the paths to the
  input and output knob textures relative to _Node\_Editor/Resources_. Defaults are
  _Textures/In_Knob.png_ and _Textures/Out_Knob.png_. 
- The type this declaration representates (e.g. 'typeof(float)') is stored in
  the __Type 'Type'__. 

## Customizing

Even though you can already built small extensions with methods described above
pretty well, to natively integrate Node Editor into your own editor extension
you may want to cutomize it, from building your own editor interface to
modifying and extending the framework itself. 

### Interface

The provided Editor Window basically serves as the default Node Canvas explorer
for all dependant extensions and single canvases, but also as a starting point
to develop a custom Editor Window from. That means, you can savely delete it if
you don't want it in your extension. In the following I'll outline all things
you need to consider to build a basic Node Editor Interface in both Runtime and
the Editor.

#### Saving and Loading Canvas and Editor State

The Editor needs to store the currently opened Canvas (`NodeCanvas`) and it's
Editor State (`NodeEditorState`). For an explanation of these, please look up
the Framework Overview. You can save both using `NodeEditor.SaveNodeCanvas` and
load them with `NodeEditor.LoadNodeCanvas` and `NodeEditor.LoadEditorStates`.
Take reference from the default `NodeEditorWindow` to see how exactly these
functions are integrated. The function `AutoOpenCanvas` also shows how to
automatically open a canvas by double-clicking it's asset in the Editor. 

#### Bringing the canvas on screen

First, you need to make sure that the `NodeEditor` is initiated using
`NodeEditor.checkInit`, and that there is always a canvas loaded, else creating
a new one. Before drawing you'll want to define the rect in which the canvas is
drawn. No boundaries are set anymore on where the canvas is set, in how many
subgroups, etc. Only the case of modifying the `GUI.matrix` scale before is not
yet supported. You currently must assign the rect to the `canvasRect` property
of the `EditorState`. In order to best account for errors, the following drawing
statement is embedded in a try-catch block catching only UnityExceptions,
unloading the old and creating a new canvas when an error occurs. Draw the
canvas by passing both the `NodeCanvas` and the `EditorState` into
`NodeEditor.DrawCanvas`, which will behave like an ordinary GUI control in most
cases.

#### Custom GUISkin

The GUISkin of the Node Editor can currently only be changed by modifying the
`NodeEditorGUI.cs` source file or by simply replacing the textures. For the
future a more extensive and seperated control over the GUISkin is planned.

## Framework overview

This section aims to bring you a decent overview on how the framework is
structured, so you can get to modify it quickly. This does not necessarily
include implementation details â€“ code sections that need extra detailing are
commented. Also, this section is not only for those planning to get into the
code, but for everyone to get an overview what he's working with:)

### `NodeCanvas` and `NodeEditorState`

Those two components essentially make up something you can load up into the
Editor. Basically, the canvas is the important part with all the nodes and any
additional information directly related to the Canvas. In contrary, the
`EditorState` holds all information on the state, or in other words, on how the
Canvas is presented. This includes zoom and pan values, selected Nodes, the
canvasRect, etc. Not all of these values are actually saved with the asset,
though. That structure allows for multiple 'views' on the same Canvas and
editing it simultaneously.

### The `DrawCanvas` function

This function acts very similar to any other GUI control, with a few exceptions,
and is responsible for drawing the Canvas. On the first glance it's just a
wrapper for `DrawSubCanvas`, with the exception that it holds the `OverlayGUI`
and `NodeGUISkin` code. `DrawSubCanvas` is used in the future for Nested
Canvases, as the name proposes.

In the first major block, the background texture is sliced and placd across the
screen where needed, accounting for pan and zoom, relative to the rect center.
In the function `InputEvents` all inputs are catched. It's well commented, so no
further explanation is necessary here. It accounts for Rects that should be
ignored for input.

Then, the scale area gets initiated with a call to my custom solution
`GUIScaleUtility.BeginScale`. Any GUI code afterwards is getting scaled
appropriately.

In the following, everything that needs to be scaled gets drawn, including
temporal connections, node transitions, connections, bodies and knobs.
Thereafter, the scale area gets closed again with another call to
`GUIScaleUtility.EndScale`. The `LateEvents` function checks all inputs with
secondary priority (after the nodes) just like `InputEvents` does, in this case
it only makes sure the node can only be dragged when not clicking on a control
(`GUI.hotControl` is 0).

## Events

(WIP)

The Framework supports a multitude of Events which might be important during the
editing process. Those Events can either be received by subscribing to the
appropriate delegate in the NodeEditorCallbacks class or by extending from
NodeEditorCallbackReceiver (which is a MonoBehaviour) and overriding the
appropriate method. Both classes can be found in _NodeEditorCallbackReceiver.cs_.
Current Events include:

- `OnEditorStartup` : The Node Editor gets initiated (can also happen when
  switching scene or playmode)
- `OnLoadCanvas` (NodeCanvas): The passed canvas has been loaded (copy)
- `OnLoadEditorState` (NodeEditorState): The passed editorState has been loaded
  (copy)
- `OnSaveCanvas` (NodeCanvas): The passed canvas has been saved (copy)
- `OnSaveEditorState` (NodeEditorState): The passed editorState has been saved
  (copy)
- `OnAddNode` (Node): The passed node has been created or duplicated
- `OnDeleteNode` (Node): The passed node will get deleted
- `OnMoveNode` (Node): The passed node has been moved by the user
- `OnAddConnection` (NodeInput): A new connection has been added to the passed
  input. If it had a connection before, OnRemoveConnection has been called, too
- `OnRemoveConnection` (NodeInput): The connection will get removed from this
  input
- `OnAddTransition` (Transition): The passed transition has been created
- `OnRemoveTransition` (Transition): The passed transition will be removed
